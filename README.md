# Toolbox

This toolbox is meant for developing a front-end web-application for Strapi. It consist of various tools that can be copied and modified to be used in other (Vue3)  webapplications. Don't forget that in order to use this application, you'll first need to create a .env file and specify the `VITE_STRAPI_REST_ENDPOINT` property. 

For example
```
VITE_STRAPI_REST_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:1337/api
```
**Important** If the api is present at a specific endpoint (like /api in the example above), don't forget to include that as well!
